# CAD Designs

A collection of various CAD designs I have created or experimented with (that are not part of my other repositories).

## Software

[Altium Designer](http://www.altium.com/altium-designer/overview): Electrical schematics and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout

[KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org): Electrical schematics and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layout

[SolidWorks](http://www.solidworks.com): Mechanical design and physical modelling

[SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com): Physical modelling, sketching, and drawing


## Key Designs - UTAT (University of Toronto Aerospace Team), Space Systems division

**KiCad - pay_led** - A PCB with LEDs to control the experiment

**KiCad - pay_sensors** - A PCB with LEDs and optical sensors to control and monitor the experiment; various optical sensor designs (custom photodiode and op amp, integrated photodiode and op amp, intensity to frequency) are prototyped on this board

**SolidWorks - SliderCrank** - A constrained slider crank design; done as part of CAD training for team members
